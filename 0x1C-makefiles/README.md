C - Makefiles

--------------------------------------------------
In C programming, a "Makefile" is a text file used to specify how a C project should be built, which includes compiling source code files, linking them together, and creating an executable program. Makefiles are particularly useful for managing large projects with multiple source files, as they automate the build process and ensure that only the necessary components are recompiled when changes are made.
