SEARCH ALGORITHMN
----------------------------------------------------

A search algorithm in the context of data structures and algorithms refers to a method or a set of rules that are used to locate a specific item (or key) within a collection of data. The collection of data could be an array, list, tree, graph, or any other data structure. The primary goal of a search algorithm is to efficiently find the target item within the given dataset.

There are various types of search algorithms, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are some common search algorithms:

Linear Search:

In a linear search, the algorithm iterates through each item in the collection one by one until it finds the target item or reaches the end of the collection.
It is simple but may not be efficient for large datasets.
Binary Search:

Binary search is applicable only to sorted collections (arrays or lists).
It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, narrowing down the possible locations of the target item.
It is more efficient than linear search for sorted datasets.
Hashing:

Hashing involves using a hash function to map keys to indices in a data structure called a hash table.
It provides constant time average-case complexity for search operations if the hash function is well-designed.
Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS):

DFS and BFS are search algorithms commonly used in graph traversal.
DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, while BFS explores all the vertices at the current depth before moving on to the next level.
